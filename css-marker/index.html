      You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot
      get there unless you move in that direction.
      <mark> Random wandering will not </mark>
      move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make
      you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful,
      and then vengeful, and then worse).‚Äù
